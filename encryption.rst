Encrypted Containers
====================

Users can build a secure, confidential container environment by encrypting the 
root file system.

--------
Overview
--------

In apptainer >= v3.4.0 a new feature to build and run encrypted containers has
been added to allow users to encrypt the file system image within a SIF.  This
encryption can be performed using either a passphrase or asymmetrically via an
RSA key pair in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM/PKCS1) format. The container is encrypted
in transit, at rest, and even while running. In other words, there is no
intermediate, decrypted version of the container on disk.  Container decryption
occurs at runtime completely within kernel space.  


.. note::

        This feature utilizes the Linux ``dm-crypt`` library and ``cryptsetup``
        utility and requires cryptsetup version of >= 2.0.0.  This version
        should be standard with recent Linux versions such as Ubuntu 18.04,
        Debian 10 and CentOS/RHEL 7, but users of older Linux versions may have
        to update.

----------------------
Encrypting a container
----------------------

A container can be encrypted either by supplying a plaintext passphrase or a 
PEM file containing an asymmetric RSA public key.  Of these two methods the PEM
file is more secure and is therefore recommended for production use. 

.. note::

        In apptainer 3.4, the definition file stored with the container will
        not be encrypted. If it contains sensitive information you should remove
        it before encryption via ``apptainer sif del 1 myimage.sif``. Metadata
        encryption will be addressed in a future release.

An ``-e|--encrypt`` flag to ``apptainer build`` is used to indicate that the container needs to 
be encrypted.

A passphrase or a key-file used to perform the encryption is supplied at build time
via an environment variable or a command line option. 

+------------------------+-------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| **Encryption Method**  | **Environment Variable**                  | **Commandline Option**   |
+------------------------+-------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| Passphrase             | ``apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE``     | ``--passphrase``         |
+------------------------+-------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| Asymmetric Key (PEM)   | ``apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PEM_PATH``       | ``--pem-path``           | 
+------------------------+-------------------------------------------+--------------------------+

The ``-e|--encrypt`` flag is implicitly set when the ``--passphrase`` or
``--pem-path`` flags are passed with the build command.  If multiple encryption
related flags and/or environment variables are set, the following precedence is
respected.  

#. ``--pem-path``
#. ``--passphrase``
#. ``apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PEM_PATH``
#. ``apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE``

Passphrase Encryption
=====================

.. note::

        Passphrase encryption is less secure than encrypting containers using an 
        RSA key pair (detailed below).  Passphrase encryption is provided as a 
        convenience, and as a way for users to familiarize themselves with the 
        encrypted container workflow, but users running encrypted containers in 
        production are encouraged to use asymmetric keys.   

In case of plaintext passphrase encryption, a passphrase is supplied by one of 
the following methods.

Encrypting with a passphrase interactively
------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none

        $ sudo apptainer build --passphrase encrypted.sif encrypted.def
        Enter encryption passphrase: <secret>
        INFO:    Starting build...

Using an environment variable
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: none

        $ sudo apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE=<secret> apptainer build --encrypt encrypted.sif encrypted.def
        Starting build...

In this case it is necessary to use the ``--encrypt`` flag since the presence of
an environment variable alone will not trigger the encrypted build workflow.

While this example shows how an environment variable can be used to set a
passphrase, you should set the environment variable in a way that will not 
record your passphrase on the command line.  For instance, you could save a 
plain text passphrase in a file (e.g. ``secret.txt``) and use it like so.

.. code-block:: none

        $ export apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE=$(cat secret.txt)

        $ sudo -E apptainer build --encrypt encrypted.sif encrypted.def
        Starting build...

PEM File Encryption
===================

apptainer currently supports RSA encryption using a public/private key-pair. 
Keys are supplied in PEM format. The public key is used to encrypt containers that
can be decrypted on a host that has access to the secret private key.

You can create a pair of RSA keys suitable for encrypting your container with 
the ``ssh-keygen`` command, and then create a PEM file with a few specific flags 
like so:

.. code-block:: none

        # Generate a keypair
        $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
        Generating public/private rsa key pair.
        Enter file in which to save the key (/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa): rsa
        Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
        Enter same passphrase again:
        [snip...]

        # Convert the public key to PEM PKCS1 format
        $ ssh-keygen -f ./rsa.pub -e -m pem >rsa_pub.pem

        # Rename the private key (already PEM PKCS1) to a nice name
        $ mv rsa rsa_pri.pem

You would use the ``rsa_pub.pem`` file to encrypt your container and the ``rsa_pri.pem`` 
file to run it.  

Encrypting with a command line option
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none

        $ sudo apptainer build --pem-path=rsa_pub.pem encrypted.sif encrypted.def
        Starting build...

Encrypting with an environment variable
---------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none

        $ sudo apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PEM_PATH=rsa_pub.pem apptainer build --encrypt encrypted.sif encrypted.def
        Starting build...

In this case it is necessary to use the ``--encrypt`` flag since the presence of
an environment variable alone will not trigger the encrypted build workflow.

------------------------------
Running an encrypted container
------------------------------

To ``run``, ``shell``, or ``exec`` an encrypted image, credentials to decrypt 
the image need to be supplied at runtime either in a key-file or a plaintext 
passphrase.

Running a container encrypted with a passphrase
===============================================

A passphrase can be supplied at runtime by either of the ways listed in the 
sections above.

Running with a passphrase interactively
---------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none

        $ apptainer run --passphrase encrypted.sif
        Enter passphrase for encrypted container: <secret>

Running with a passphrase in an environment variable
----------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none

        $ apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE="secret" apptainer run encrypted.sif

While this example shows how an environment variable can be used to set a
passphrase, you should set the environment variable in a way that will not 
record your passphrase on the command line.  For instance, you could save a 
plain text passphrase in a file (e.g. ``secret.txt``) and use it like so.

.. code-block:: none

        $ export apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE=$(cat secret.txt)

        $ apptainer run encrypted.sif

Running a container encrypted with a PEM file
=============================================

A private key is supplied using either of the methods listed in the Encryption 
section above.

Running using a command line option
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: none

        $ apptainer run --pem-path=rsa_pri.pem encrypted.sif

Running using an environment variable
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none

        $ apptainer_ENCRYPTION_PEM_PATH=rsa_pri.pem apptainer run encrypted.sif
