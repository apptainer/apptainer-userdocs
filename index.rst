Welcome to the {Project} User Guide!

This guide aims to give an introduction to {Project}, brief
installation instructions, and cover topics relevant to users building
and running containers.

For a detailed guide to installation and configuration, please see the
separate `Admin Guide <{admindocs}>`_ for this version of {Project}.

*********************
 Building Containers
*********************

Learn how to write a definition file that can be used to build a
container. Understand the environment within a build, how to perform
remote builds, and how to use the ``--fakeroot`` feature to build as a
non-root user.

********************************
 Container Signing & Encryption
********************************

{Project} allows containers to be signed using a PGP key. The
signature travels with the container image, allowing you to verify that
the image is unmodified at any time. Encryption of containers using
LUKS2 is also supported. Encrypted containers can be run without
decrypting them to disk first.
