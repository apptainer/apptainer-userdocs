Persistent Overlays
###################

Persistent overlay directories allow you to overlay a writable file
system on an immutable read-only container for the illusion of
read-write access. You can run a container and make changes, and these
changes are kept separately from the base container image.

********
Overview
********

A persistent overlay is a directory or file system image that "sits on
top" of your immutable SIF container. When you install new software or
create and modify files the overlay will store the changes.

If you want to use a SIF container as though it were writable, you can
create a directory, an ext3 file system image, or embed an ext3 file
system image in SIF to use as a persistent overlay. Then you can specify
that you want to use the directory or image as an overlay at runtime
with the ``--overlay`` option, or ``--writable`` if you want to modify
the overlay embedded in SIF.

.. note::
    By default for security reasons the ext3 format is only supported in
    unprivileged user namespace mode, so unless that default is changed a
    ``-u/--userns`` option may be needed with a setuid-root installation.

If you want to make changes to the image, but do not want them to
persist, use the ``--writable-tmpfs`` option. This stores all changes in
an in-memory temporary filesystem which is discarded as soon as the
container finishes executing.

.. note::

   The ``--writable-tmpfs`` size is controlled by ``sessiondir max size`` in
   ``{command}.conf``. This defaults to 64MiB, and may need to be increased if
   your workflows create larger temporary files.

You can use persistent overlays with the following commands:

-  ``run``
-  ``exec``
-  ``shell``
-  ``instance start``

Usage
*****

Filesystem image overlay
========================

{Project} provides a command ``{command} overlay
create`` to create persistent overlay images.

.. note::

   ``dd`` and ``mkfs.ext3`` must be installed on your system.
   Additionally ``mkfs.ext3`` must support ``-d`` option in order to
   create an overlay directory tree usable by a regular user.

For example, to create a 1 GiB overlay image:

.. code::

   $ {command} overlay create --size 1024 /tmp/ext3_overlay.img

``{command} overlay create`` also provides an option ``--create-dir`` to
create additional directories owned by the calling user. This option can be
specified multiple times to create several such directories. This is
particularly useful when you need to make a directory that is writable by your
user.

For example:

.. code::

   $ {command} build /tmp/nginx.sif docker://nginx
   ...
   $ {command} overlay create --size 1024 --create-dir /var/cache/nginx /tmp/nginx_overlay.img
   $ echo "test" | {command} exec --overlay /tmp/nginx_overlay.img /tmp/nginx.sif sh -c "cat > /var/cache/nginx/test"

Sparse overlay images
---------------------

{Project} allows the creation of overlay images as sparse files.
A sparse overlay image only takes up space on disk as data is written to it. A
standard overlay image will use an amount of disk space equal to its size, from
the time that it is created.

To create a sparse overlay image, use the ``--sparse`` flag.

.. code::

   $ {command} overlay create --sparse --size 1024 /tmp/ext3_overlay.img

Note that ``ls`` will show the full size of the file, while ``du`` will show the
space on disk that the file is currently using:

.. code::

   $ ls -lah /tmp/ext3_overlay.img
   -rw-------. 1 user user 1.0G Jan 27 11:47 /tmp/ext3_overlay.img

   $ du -h /tmp/ext3_overlay.img
   33M     /tmp/ext3_overlay.img

If you copy or move the sparse image you should ensure that the tool you use to
do so supports sparse files, which may require enabling an option. Failure to
copy or move the file with sparse file support will lead to it taking its full
size on disk in the new location.

Create an overlay image manually
--------------------------------

You can use tools like ``dd`` and ``mkfs.ext3`` to create and format an
empty ext3 file system image that will be used as an overlay.

Fakeroot with overlay
=====================

If you want to be able to modify the container with an overlay
(including with ``--writable-tmpfs``) you will generally want to run it
either as root or with ``--fakeroot`` because usually containers are
modifiable only by root.

If that is the way you plan to use the image, then when creating the
filesystem image with ``overlay create`` also give it a ``--fakeroot``
option.

For example:

.. code::

   $ {command} build ubuntu.sif docker://ubuntu
   ...
   $ {command} overlay create --fakeroot --size 1024 overlay.img
   $ {command} shell --fakeroot --overlay overlay.img ubuntu.sif
   {Project}> which vim
   {Project}> apt-get update && apt-get install -y vim
   ...
   {Project}> which vim
   /usr/bin/vim

An exception is if you are using the 4th :ref:`fakeroot mode <fakeroot>`
with a setuid installation and no unprivileged user namespaces available.
In that case the ``--fakeroot`` option to ``overlay create`` makes
the overlay image unwritable, so leave it out.
This case also has other restrictions in that it only works when the
underlying image is a sandbox directory, and yet the overlay itself must
not be a directory.

Directory overlay
=================

A directory overlay is simpler to use than a filesystem image overlay.
On the other hand, a directory of modifications to a base container image
cannot be transported or shared as easily as a single overlay file,
and it generally does not work well on network file servers
(see the `NFS <{admindocs}/installation.html#nfs>`_ and
`Lustre / GPFS <{admindocs}/installation.html#lustre-gpfs>`_
sections of the admin guide).
It is supported, however, and this section describes how to use it.

.. note::

   For security reasons, if {Project} is installed in setuid mode, you must
   be root to use a bare directory as an overlay. ext3 file system images can be
   used as overlays without root privileges.
   If unprivileged user namespaces are also available, however, the
   ``--userns`` or ``--fakeroot`` options should make it work.

Create a directory as usual:

.. code::

   $ mkdir my_overlay

The example below shows the directory overlay in action.

.. code::

   $ {command} shell --fakeroot --overlay my_overlay ubuntu.sif
   {Project}> mkdir /data
   {Project}> apt-get update && apt-get install -y vim
   ...
   {Project}> which vim
   /usr/bin/vim

You will find that your changes persist across sessions as though you
were using a writable container.

.. code::

   $ {command} shell --userns --overlay my_overlay ubuntu.sif
   {Project}> ls -ld /data
   drwxr-xr-x 2 user group 4096 Apr  9 10:21 /data
   {Project}> which vim
   /usr/bin/vim

If you mount your container without the ``--overlay`` directory, your
changes will be gone.

.. code::

   $ {command} shell ubuntu.sif
   {Project}> ls /data
   ls: cannot access 'data': No such file or directory
   {Project}> which vim

Readonly overlay
================

After all modifications to an overlay (either ext3 image or directory)
have been completed,
it can be mounted read-only by appending a ``:ro`` to the overlay path
and no longer needs to use ``--fakeroot``.

Continuing the above example:

.. code::

   $ {command} shell --userns --overlay my_overlay:ro ubuntu.sif
   {Project}> which vim
   /usr/bin/vim
   {Project}> touch /usr/bin/myfile
   touch: cannot touch '/usr/bin/more': Read-only file system

.. _overlay-sif:

Overlay embedded in SIF
=======================

It is possible to embed an overlay image into the SIF file that holds a
container. This allows the read-only container image and your
modifications to it to be managed as a single file.

To add a 1 GiB writable overlay partition to an existing SIF image:

.. code::

   $ {command} overlay create --size 1024 ubuntu.sif

.. warning::

   It is not possible to add a writable overlay partition to a
   **signed**, **encrypted** SIF image or if the SIF image already
   contains a writable overlay partition.

``{command} overlay create`` also provides an option ``--create-dir``
to create additional directories owned by the calling user, it can be
specified multiple times to create many directories. This is
particularly useful when you need to make a directory writable by your
user.

So for example:

.. code::

   $ {command} build /tmp/nginx.sif docker://nginx
   $ {command} overlay create --size 1024 --create-dir /var/cache/nginx /tmp/nginx.sif
   $ echo "test" | {command} exec /tmp/nginx.sif sh -c "cat > /var/cache/nginx/test"


Embed an overlay image in SIF
-----------------------------

To embed an existing overlay in a SIF image, or to create an empty overlay,
use the ``sif add`` subcommand.

In order to do this, you must first create a file system image:

.. code::

   $ {command} sif add --datatype 4 --partfs 2 --parttype 4 --partarch 2 --groupid 1 ubuntu.sif overlay.img
   $ {command} sif list ubuntu.sif | grep -i ext3
   5    |1       |NONE    |29810688-1103552512       |FS (Ext3/Overlay/amd64)

Below is the explanation what each parameter means, and how it can
possibly affect the operation:

-  ``datatype`` determines what kind of an object we attach, e.g. a
   definition file, environment variable, signature.
-  ``partfs`` should be set according to the partition type, e.g.
   SquashFS, ext3, raw.
-  ``parttype`` determines the type of partition. In our case it is
   being set to overlay.
-  ``partarch`` must be set to the architecture against which you're building.
   In this case it's ``amd64``.
-  ``groupid`` is the ID of the container image group. In most cases
   there's no more than one group, therefore we can assume it is 1.

All of these options are documented within the CLI help. Access it by
running ``{command} sif add --help``.

Unlike the ``--overlay`` option, an overlay image inside a SIF is by
default mounted readonly.
To modify the overlay image, use the ``--writable`` option (and likely
also the ``--fakeroot`` option):

.. code::

   $ {command} shell --writable --fakeroot ubuntu.sif
   {Project}> apt-get update && apt-get install -y vim
   ...
   {Project}> exit
   $ {command} exec ubuntu.sif which vim
   /usr/bin/vim

Final note
==========

To resize an overlay, standard Linux tools which manipulate ext3 images can be
used. For instance, to resize the 500MB file created above to 700MB one could
use the ``e2fsck`` and ``resize2fs`` utilities as follows:

.. code::

   $ e2fsck -f overlay.img && \
       resize2fs overlay.img 700M

More information on creating and manipulating ext3 images on various Linux
distribution are available where documentation for those respective
distributions is found.
