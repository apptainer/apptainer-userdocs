This guide is intended for running {Project} on a computer where you
will install {Project} yourself.

If you need to request an installation on your shared resource, see the
:ref:`requesting an installation section <installation-request>` for
information to send to your system administrator.

For any additional help or support contact the {Project} Community:
https://apptainer.org/help

.. _quick-installation:

******************
Quick Installation
******************

You will need a Linux system to run {Project} natively and it's easiest
to install if you have root access.

To install from source, follow the instructions in the `INSTALL.md
<https://github.com/{orgrepo}/blob/{repobranch}/INSTALL.md>`_
on github.
Other installation options,
including installing from a pre-built RPM,
building an RPM or Debian package,
installing {Project} without root privileges,
and using {Project} on Mac and Windows machines
are discussed in the `installation section of the admin guide
<{admindocs}/installation.html>`__.

***************************************
Overview of the {Project} Interface
***************************************

{Project}'s :ref:`command line interface <cli>` allows you to build
and interact with containers transparently. You can run programs inside
a container as if they were running on your host system. You can easily
redirect IO, use pipes, pass arguments, and access files, sockets, and
ports on the host system from within a container.

The ``help`` command gives an overview of {Project} options and
subcommands as follows:

.. code::

   $ {command} help

   Linux container platform optimized for High Performance Computing (HPC) and
   Enterprise Performance Computing (EPC)

   Usage:
     {command} [global options...]

   Description:
     {Project} containers provide an application virtualization layer enabling
     mobility of compute via both application and environment portability. With
     {Project} one is capable of building a root file system that runs on any
     other Linux system where {Project} is installed.

   Options:
     -d, --debug     print debugging information (highest verbosity)
     -h, --help      help for {command}
         --nocolor   print without color output (default False)
     -q, --quiet     suppress normal output
     -s, --silent    only print errors
     -v, --verbose   print additional information

   Available Commands:
     build       Build {aProject} image
     cache       Manage the local cache

   For additional help or support, please visit https://www.apptainer.org/docs/

Information about individual subcommands can also be viewed by using the
``help`` command:

.. code::

   $ {command} help verify
   Verify cryptographic signatures attached to an image

   Usage:
     {command} verify [verify options...] <image path>

   Description:
     The verify command allows a user to verify cryptographic signatures on SIF
     container files. There may be multiple signatures for data objects and
     multiple data objects signed. By default the command searches for the primary
     partition signature. If found, a list of all verification blocks applied on
     the primary partition is gathered so that data integrity (hashing) and
     signature verification is done for all those blocks.

   Options:
     -a, --all               verify all objects
     -g, --group-id uint32   verify objects with the specified group ID
     -h, --help              help for verify
     -j, --json              output json
         --legacy-insecure   enable verification of (insecure) legacy signatures
     -l, --local             only verify with local keys
     -i, --sif-id uint32     verify object with the specified ID
     -u, --url string        key server URL (default "https://keys.openpgp.org")


   Examples:
     $ {command} verify container.sif


   For additional help or support, please visit https://www.apptainer.org/docs/

{Project} uses positional syntax (i.e. the order of commands and options
matters). Global options affecting the behavior of all commands follow
immediately after the main ``{command}`` command. Then come subcommands,
followed by their options and arguments.

For example, to pass the ``--debug`` option to the main ``{command}``
command and run {Project} with debugging messages on:

.. code::

   $ {command} --debug run docker://alpine

To pass the ``--containall`` option to the ``run`` command and run a
{Project} image in an isolated manner:

.. code::

   $ {command} run --containall docker://alpine

{Project} has the concept of command groups. For
instance, to list Linux capabilities for a particular user, you would
use the ``list`` command in the ``capability`` command group, as
follows:

.. code::

   $ {command} capability list dave

Container authors might also write help docs specific to a container, or
for an internal module called an ``app``. If those help docs exist for a
particular container, you can view them as follows:

.. code::

   $ {command} inspect --helpfile container.sif  # See the container's help, if provided

   $ {command} inspect --helpfile --app=foo foo.sif  # See the help for foo, if provided

******************
Downloading images
******************

You can use the `pull
<cli/{command}_pull.html>`_
and `build
<cli/{command}_build.html>`_
commands to download images from an external resource like an OCI registry.

You can use ``pull`` with the ``docker://`` uri to reference OCI
images served from an OCI registry. In this case ``pull`` does not just
download an image file. OCI images are stored in layers, so ``pull``
must also combine those layers into a usable {Project} file.

.. code::

   $ {command} pull docker://alpine

You can also use the ``build`` command to download pre-built images from
an external resource. When using ``build`` you must specify a name for
your container like so:

.. code::

   $ {command} build alpine.sif docker://alpine

Unlike ``pull``, ``build`` will convert your image to the latest
{Project} image format after downloading it. ``build`` is like a
"Swiss Army knife" for container creation. In addition to downloading
images, you can use ``build`` to create images from other images or from
scratch using a :ref:`definition file <definition-files>`. You can also
use ``build`` to convert an image between the container formats
supported by {Project}. To see a comparison of the {Project}
definition file with Dockerfile, please see: :ref:`this section
<sec:deffile-vs-dockerfile>`.

.. _cowimage:

***********************
Interacting with images
***********************

You can interact with images in several ways, each of which can accept
image URIs in addition to a local image path.

As an example, the following command will pull a ``lolcow_latest.sif`` image
from ghcr.io:

.. code::

   $ {command} pull docker://ghcr.io/apptainer/lolcow

Shell
=====

The `shell
<cli/{command}_shell.html>`_
command allows you to spawn a new shell within your container and
interact with it as though it were a virtual machine.

.. code::

   $ {command} shell lolcow_latest.sif

   {Project} lolcow_latest.sif:~>

The change in prompt indicates that you have entered the container
(though you should not rely on prompt forms to determine whether you are in
a container or not).

Once inside of {aProject} container, you are the same user as you
are on the host system.

.. code::

   {Project} lolcow_latest.sif:~> whoami
   david

   {Project} lolcow_latest.sif:~> id
   uid=1000(david) gid=1000(david) groups=1000(david),65534(nfsnobody)

``shell`` also works with the ``docker://``, ``oras://``, ``library://``,  and
``shub://`` URIs. This creates an ephemeral container that disappears
when the shell is exited.

.. code::

   $ {command} shell docker://ghcr.io/apptainer/lolcow

Executing Commands
==================

The `exec
<cli/{command}_exec.html>`_
command allows you to execute a custom command within a container by
specifying the image file. For instance, to execute the ``cowsay``
program within the ``lolcow_latest.sif`` container:

.. code::

   $ {command} exec lolcow_latest.sif cowsay moo
    _____
   < moo >
    -----
           \   ^__^
            \  (oo)\_______
               (__)\       )\/\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||

``exec`` also works with the ``docker://``, ``oras://``, ``library://``, and
``shub://`` URIs. This creates an ephemeral container that executes a
command and disappears.

.. code::

   $ {command} exec docker://ghcr.io/apptainer/lolcow cowsay 'Fresh from the internet'
    _________________________
   < Fresh from the internet >
    -------------------------
           \   ^__^
            \  (oo)\_______
               (__)\       )\/\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||

.. _runcontainer:

Running a container
===================

{Project} containers contain :ref:`runscripts <runscript>`. These
are user-defined scripts that define the actions a container should
perform when someone runs it. The runscript can be triggered with the
`run
<cli/{command}_run.html>`_
command, or simply by calling the container as though it were an
executable.

.. code::

   $ {command} run lolcow_latest.sif
   ______________________________
   < Mon Aug 16 13:01:55 CDT 2021 >
    ------------------------------
           \   ^__^
            \  (oo)\_______
               (__)\       )\/\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||

   $ ./lolcow_latest.sif
   ______________________________
   < Mon Aug 16 13:12:50 CDT 2021 >
    ------------------------------
           \   ^__^
            \  (oo)\_______
               (__)\       )\/\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||

``run`` also works with the ``docker://``, ``oras://``, ``library://``, and
``shub://`` URIs. This creates an ephemeral container that runs and then
disappears.

.. code::

   $ {command} run docker://ghcr.io/apptainer/lolcow
   ______________________________
   < Mon Aug 16 13:12:33 CDT 2021 >
    ------------------------------
           \   ^__^
            \  (oo)\_______
               (__)\       )\/\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||


Arguments to ``run``
--------------------

You can pass arguments to the runscript of a container, if it accepts
them. For example, the default runscript of the ``docker://alpine``
container passes any arguments to a shell. We can ask the container
to run ``echo`` command in this shell as follows:

.. code::

   $ {command} run docker://alpine echo "hello"

   hello

Because {Project} runscripts are evaluated shell scripts, arguments
can behave slightly differently than in Docker/OCI runtimes, if they
contain expressions that have special meaning to the shell. Here is an
illustrative example:

.. code::

   $ docker run -it --rm alpine echo "\$HOSTNAME"
   $HOSTNAME

   $ {command} run docker://alpine echo "\$HOSTNAME"
   p700

   $ {command} run docker://alpine echo "\\\$HOSTNAME"
   $HOSTNAME

To replicate Docker/OCI behavior, you may need additional escaping or
quoting of arguments.

Unlike the ``run`` command, the ``exec`` command replicates the Docker/OCI
behavior, as it calls the specified executable directly:

.. code::

   $ {command} exec docker://alpine echo "\$HOSTNAME"
   $HOSTNAME

   $ {command} exec docker://alpine echo "\\\$HOSTNAME"
   \$HOSTNAME

******************
Working with Files
******************

Files on the host are reachable from within the container:

.. code::

   $ echo "Hello from inside the container" > $HOME/hostfile.txt

   $ {command} exec lolcow_latest.sif cat $HOME/hostfile.txt

   Hello from inside the container

This example works because ``hostfile.txt`` exists in the user's home
directory. By default, {Project} bind mounts ``/home/$USER``,
``/tmp``, and ``$PWD`` into your container at runtime.

You can specify additional directories to bind mount into your container
with the ``--bind`` option. In this example, the ``data`` directory on
the host system is bind mounted to the ``/mnt`` directory inside the
container.

.. code::

   $ echo "Drink milk (and never eat hamburgers)." > /data/cow_advice.txt

   $ {command} exec --bind /data:/mnt lolcow_latest.sif cat /mnt/cow_advice.txt
   Drink milk (and never eat hamburgers).

Pipes and redirects also work with {Project} commands, just like they
do with normal Linux commands:

.. code::

   $ cat /data/cow_advice.txt | {command} exec lolcow_latest.sif cowsay
    ________________________________________
   < Drink milk (and never eat hamburgers). >
    ----------------------------------------
           \   ^__^
            \  (oo)\_______
               (__)\       )\/\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||

.. _build-images-from-scratch:

****************************
Building images from scratch
****************************

.. _sec:buildimagesfromscratch:

{Project} produces immutable images in the
Singularity Image File (SIF) format. This ensures reproducible and
verifiable images and allows for many extra benefits such as the ability
to sign and verify your containers.

However, during testing and debugging you may want an image format that
is writable. This way you can ``shell`` into the image and install
software and dependencies until you are satisfied that your container
will fulfill your needs. For these scenarios, {Project} also
supports the ``sandbox`` format (which is really just a directory).

Sandbox Directories
===================

To build into a ``sandbox`` (container in a directory) use the ``build
--sandbox`` command and option:

.. code::

   $ {command} build --sandbox ubuntu/ docker://ubuntu

This command creates a directory called ``ubuntu/`` with an entire
Ubuntu Operating System and some {Project} metadata in your current
working directory.

You can use commands like ``shell``, ``exec`` , and ``run`` with this
directory just as you would with {aProject} image. If you pass the
``--writable`` option when you use your container, you can also write
files within the sandbox directory (provided you have the permissions to
do so).

.. code::

   $ {command} exec --writable ubuntu touch /foo

   $ {command} exec ubuntu/ ls /foo
   /foo

Converting images from one format to another
============================================

The ``build`` command allows you to build a new container from an existing
container. This means that you can use it to convert a container from one format
to another. For instance, if you have already created a sandbox (directory) and
want to convert it to the Singularity Image Format you can do so:

.. code::

   $ {command} build new.sif sandbox

Doing so may break reproducibility if you have altered your sandbox outside of
the context of a :ref:`definition file <qs-def-files>`, so you are advised
to exercise care.

.. _qs-def-files:

{Project} Definition Files
==============================

For a reproducible, verifiable and production-quality container, it is
recommended that you build a SIF file using {aProject} definition file.
This also makes it easy to add files, environment variables, and install custom
software. You can start with base images from Docker Hub and use
images directly from official repositories such as Ubuntu, Debian,
CentOS, Arch, and BusyBox.

A definition file has a header and a body. The header determines the
base container to begin with, and the body is further divided into
sections that perform tasks such as software installation, environment
setup, and copying files into the container from host system.

Here is an example of a definition file:

.. code:: {command}

   BootStrap: docker
   From: ubuntu:22.04

   %post
      apt-get -y update
      apt-get -y install cowsay lolcat

   %environment
      export LC_ALL=C
      export PATH=/usr/games:$PATH

   %runscript
      date | cowsay | lolcat

   %labels
      Author Alice

To build a container from this definition file (assuming it is a file
named ``lolcow.def``), you would call ``build`` as follows:

.. code::

   $ {command} build lolcow.sif lolcow.def

In this example, the header tells {Project} to use a base Ubuntu 22.04 image
from the Container Library. The other sections in this definition file are as
follows:

-  The ``%post`` section is executed within the container at build time, after
   the base OS has been installed. The ``%post`` section is therefore the place
   to perform installations of new libraries and applications.

-  The ``%environment`` section defines environment variables that will be
   available to the container at runtime.

-  The ``%runscript`` section defines actions for the container to take
   when it is executed. (These commands will therefore not be run at build time.)

-  And finally, the ``%labels`` section allows for custom metadata to be
   added to the container.

This is a very small example of the things that you can do with a
:ref:`definition file <definition-files>`. You can also use an
existing container on your host system as a base.

This quickstart document just scratches the surface of all of the things
you can do with {Project}!

.. _installation-request:

*********************************
{Project} on a shared resource
*********************************

Perhaps you are a user who wants a few talking points and background to
share with your administrator. Or maybe you are an administrator who
needs to decide whether to install {Project}.

This document and the accompanying administrator documentation provide
answers to many common questions.

If you need to request an installation from your administrator, you may decide
to draft a message similar to this:

.. code::

   Dear shared resource administrator,

   We are interested in having {Project} (https://apptainer.org)
   installed on our shared resource. {Project} containers will allow us to
   build encapsulated environments, meaning that our work is reproducible and
   we are empowered to choose all dependencies including libraries, operating
   system, and custom software. {Project} is already in use on many of the
   top HPC centers around the world. Examples include:

       Texas Advanced Computing Center
       GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research
       Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility
       Purdue University
       National Institutes of Health HPC
       UFIT Research Computing at the University of Florida
       San Diego Supercomputing Center
       Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
       University of Chicago
       McGill HPC Centre/Calcul Québec
       Barcelona Supercomputing Center
       Sandia National Lab
       Argonne National Lab

   Importantly, it has a vibrant team of developers, scientists, and HPC
   administrators that invest heavily in the security and development of the
   software, and are quick to respond to the needs of the community. To help
   learn more about {Project}, I thought these items might be of interest:

       - Security: A discussion of security concerns is discussed at
       {admindocs}/admin_quickstart.html

       - Installation:
       {admindocs}/installation.html

   If you have questions about any of the above, you can contact one of the
   sources listed at https://apptainer.org/help. I can do my best
   to facilitate this interaction if help is needed.

   Thank you kindly for considering this request!

   Best,

   User
