Library API Registries
######################

********
Overview
********

{Project} enables users to use `Library API Container Registries
<https://singularityhub.github.io/library-api/#/?id=library-api>`_ to
:ref:`push <push>` containers to a registry that was designed specifically for
SIF images and :ref:`pull <pull>` SIF images created by others.

Many Library API registries will require authentication to perform operations
like pushing container images or pulling potentially private container images.
The ``remote`` command group governs the authentication for Library API
registries. Check out the instructions for how to add and login with a
:ref:`remote endpoint <remote_add_and_login>`.

Once you have authenticated, you are ready to push your container!

.. _push:

*******************
Pushing a Container
*******************

The ``{command} push`` command will push a container to the container
library with the given URL. Here's an example of a typical push command:

.. code::

   $ {command} push my-container.sif library://your-name/project-dir/my-container:latest

The ``:latest`` is the container tag. Tags are used to have different
version of the same container.

.. note::

   When pushing your container, there's no need to add a ``.sif``
   (Singularity Image Format) to the end of the container name, (like on
   your local machine), because all containers on the library are SIF
   containers.

Let's assume you have your container (v1.0.1), and you want to push that
container without deleting your ``:latest`` container, then you can add
a version tag to that container, like so:

.. code::

   $ {command} push my-container.sif library://your-name/project-dir/my-container:1.0.1

You can download the container with that tag by replacing the
``:latest``, with the tagged container you want to download.

To set a description against the container image as you push it, use the
`-D` flag introduced in {Project} 3.7. This provides an alternative
to setting the description via the web interface:

.. code:: console

   $ {command} push -D "My alpine 3.11 container" alpine_3.11.sif library://myuser/examples/alpine:3.11
   2.7MiB / 2.7MiB [=========================================================================] 100 % 1.1 MiB/s 0s

   Library storage: using 13.24 MiB out of 11.00 GiB quota (0.1% used)
   Container URL: https://cloud.example.com/library/myuser/examples/alpine

Note that when you push to a library that supports it, {Project} will report
your quota usage and the direct URL to view the container in your web browser.

.. _pull:

*******************
Pulling a container
*******************

The ``{command} pull`` command will download a container from an
`OCI Registry <https://hub.docker.com/>`_ (``docker://``),
`Library API Registry
<https://singularityhub.github.io/library-api/#/?id=library-api>`_
(``library://``), and also `Shub
<https://singularity-hub.org>`_ (``shub://``).

.. note::

   When pulling from Docker, the container will automatically be
   converted to a SIF (Singularity Image Format) container.

Here's a typical pull command:

.. code::

   $ {command} pull file-out.sif library://alpine:latest

   # or pull from docker:

   $ {command} pull file-out.sif docker://alpine:latest

.. note::

   If there's no tag after the container name, {Project}
   automatically will pull the container with the ``:latest`` tag.

To pull a container with a specific tag, just add the tag to the library
URL:

.. code::

   $ {command} pull file-out.sif library://alpine:3.8

Of course, you can pull your own containers. Here's what that will look
like:

Pulling your own container
==========================

Pulling your own container is just like pulling from Github, Docker,
etc...

.. code::

   $ {command} pull out-file.sif library://your-name/project-dir/my-container:latest

   # or use a different tag:

   $ {command} pull out-file.sif library://your-name/project-dir/my-container:1.0.1

.. note::

   You *don't* have to specify a output file, one will be created
   automatically, but it's good practice to always specify your output
   file.

**************************
Verify/Sign your Container
**************************

Verify containers that you pull from the library, ensuring they are
bit-for-bit reproductions of the original image.

Check out :ref:`this page <signNverify>` on how to: :ref:`verify a
container <verify_container_from_remote_sources>`, :ref:`making PGP key, and
sign your own containers <sign_your_own_containers>`.

.. _search_the_library:

************************************
Searching the Library for Containers
************************************

To find interesting or useful containers in a library, you can open that
library in your browser if that project supports a web GUI.

Alternatively, from the CLI you can use ``{command} search <query>``.
This will search a library for container images matching ``<query>``.

Using the CLI Search
====================

Here is an example of searching a library for ``centos``:

.. code:: console

   {command} search centos
   Found 72 container images for amd64 matching "centos":

       library://dcsouthwick/iotools/centos7:latest

       library://dcsouthwick/iotools/centos7:sha256.48e81523aaad3d74e7af8b154ac5e75f2726cc6cab37f718237d8f89d905ff89
               Minimal centos7 image from yum bootstrap

       library://dtrudg/linux/centos:7,centos7,latest

       library://dtrudg/linux/centos:centos6,6

       library://emmeff/centos/centos:8

       library://essen1999/default/centos-tree:latest

       library://gallig/default/centos_benchmark-signed:7.7.1908
               Signed by: 6B44B0BC9CD273CC6A71DA8CED6FA43EF8771A02

       library://gmk/default/centos7-devel:latest
               Signed by: 7853F08767A4596B3C1AD95E48E1080AB16ED1BC

Containers can have multiple tags, and these are shown separated by
commas after the ``:`` in the URL. E.g.
``library://dtrudg/linux/centos:7,centos7,latest`` is a single container
image with 3 tags, ``7``, ``centos7``, and ``latest``. You can
``{command} pull`` the container image using any one of these tags.

Note that the results show ``amd64`` containers only. By default
``search`` returns only containers with an architecture matching your
current system. To e.g. search for ``arm64`` containers from an
``amd64`` machine you can use the ``--arch`` flag:

.. code:: console

   {command} search --arch arm64 alpine
   Found 5 container images for arm64 matching "alpine":

       library://dtrudg-sylabs-2/multiarch/alpine:latest

       library://geoffroy.vallee/alpine/alpine:latest
               Signed by: 9D56FA7CAFB4A37729751B8A21749D0D6447B268

       library://library/default/alpine:3.11.5,latest,3,3.11

       library://library/default/alpine:3.9,3.9.2

       library://sylabs/tests/passphrase_encrypted_alpine:3.11.5

You can also limit results to only signed containers with the
``--signed`` flag:

.. code:: console

   {command} search --signed alpine
   Found 45 container images for amd64 matching "alpine":

       library://deep/default/alpine:latest,1.0.1
               Signed by: 8883491F4268F173C6E5DC49EDECE4F3F38D871E

Building from a definition file:
================================

This is our definition file. Let's call it ``ubuntu.def``:

.. code:: {command}

   bootstrap: library
   from: ubuntu:22.04

   %runscript
       echo "hello world from ubuntu container!"

Now, to build the container, use the ``--remote`` flag, and without
``sudo``:

.. code::

   $ {command} build --remote ubuntu.sif ubuntu.def

After building, you can test your container like so:

.. code::

   $ ./ubuntu.sif
   hello world from ubuntu container!
