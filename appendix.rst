.. _build-library-module:

``library`` bootstrap agent
===========================

.. _sec:build-library-module:

Overview
--------

You can use an existing container in a Container Library as your
"base" and then add customization. This allows you to build multiple
images from the same starting point. For example, you may want to build
several containers with the same custom python installation, the same
custom compiler toolchain, or the same base MPI installation. Instead of
building these from scratch each time, you could create a base container
in the Container Library and then build new containers from that
existing base container adding customizations in ``%post``,
``%environment``, ``%runscript``, etc.

This requires setting up a Container Library as shown in the
:ref:`Managing Remote Endpoints <sec:managing-remote-endpoints>`
section.

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: library

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

.. code:: {command}

   From: <entity>/<collection>/<container>:<tag>

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the container to use as
a base. ``entity`` is optional and defaults to ``library``.
``collection`` is optional and defaults to ``default``. This is the
correct namespace to use for some official containers (``alpine`` for
example). ``tag`` is also optional and will default to ``latest``.

.. code:: {command}

   Library: http://custom/library

The Library keyword is mandatory. It is the URL for the library server.

.. code:: {command}

   Fingerprints: 22045C8C0B1004D058DE4BEDA20C27EE7FF7BA84

The Fingerprints keyword is optional. It specifies one or more comma
separated fingerprints corresponding to PGP public keys. If present, the
bootstrap image will be verified and the build will only proceed if it
is signed by keys matching *all* of the specified fingerprints.

.. _build-docker-module:

``docker`` bootstrap agent
==========================

.. _sec:build-docker-module:

Overview
--------

Docker images are comprised of layers that are assembled at runtime to
create an image. You can use Docker layers to create a base image, and
then add your own custom software. For example, you might use Docker's
Ubuntu image layers to create an Ubuntu {Project} container. You
could do the same with CentOS, Debian, Arch, Suse, Alpine, BusyBox, etc.

Or maybe you want a container that already has software installed. For
instance, maybe you want to build a container that uses CUDA and cuDNN
to leverage the GPU, but you don't want to install from scratch. You can
start with one of the ``nvidia/cuda`` containers and install your
software on top of that.

Or perhaps you have already invested in Docker and created your own
Docker containers. If so, you can seamlessly convert them to
{Project} with the ``docker`` bootstrap module.

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: docker

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

.. code:: {command}

   From: <registry>/<namespace>/<container>:<tag>@<digest>

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the container to use as
a base. ``registry`` is optional and defaults to ``index.docker.io``.
``namespace`` is optional and defaults to ``library``. This is the
correct namespace to use for some official containers (ubuntu for
example). ``tag`` is also optional and will default to ``latest``

See :ref:`{Project} and Docker <docker-and-oci>` for more
detailed info on using Docker registries.

.. code:: {command}

   Registry: http://custom_registry

The Registry keyword is optional. It will default to
``index.docker.io``.

.. code:: {command}

   Namespace: namespace

The Namespace keyword is optional. It will default to ``library``.

Notes
-----

Docker containers are stored as a collection of tarballs called layers.
When building from a Docker container the layers must be downloaded and
then assembled in the proper order to produce a viable file system. Then
the file system must be converted to Singularity Image File (sif)
format.

For detailed information about setting your build environment see
:ref:`Build Customization <build-environment>`.

.. _build-shub:

``shub`` bootstrap agent
========================

Overview
--------

You can use an existing container on Singularity Hub as your "base" and
then add customization. This allows you to build multiple images from
the same starting point. For example, you may want to build several
containers with the same custom python installation, the same custom
compiler toolchain, or the same base MPI installation. Instead of
building these from scratch each time, you could create a base container
on Singularity Hub and then build new containers from that existing base
container adding customizations in ``%post`` , ``%environment``,
``%runscript``, etc.

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: shub

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

.. code:: {command}

   From: shub://<registry>/<username>/<container-name>:<tag>@digest

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the container to use as
a base. ``registry is optional and defaults to ``singularity-hub.org``.
``tag`` and ``digest`` are also optional. ``tag`` defaults to ``latest``
and ``digest`` can be left blank if you want the latest build.

Notes
-----

When bootstrapping from a Singularity Hub image, all previous definition
files that led to the creation of the current image will be stored in a
directory within the container called
``/.singularity.d/bootstrap_history``. {Project} will also alert you
if environment variables have been changed between the base image and
the new image during bootstrap.

.. _build-oras:

``oras`` bootstrap agent
========================

Overview
--------

Using, this module, a container from supporting OCI Registries - Eg: ACR
(Azure Container Registry), local container registries, etc can be used
as your "base" image and later customized. This allows you to build
multiple images from the same starting point. For example, you may want
to build several containers with the same custom python installation,
the same custom compiler toolchain, or the same base MPI installation.
Instead of building these from scratch each time, you could make use of
``oras`` to pull an appropriate base container and then build new
containers by adding customizations in ``%post`` , ``%environment``,
``%runscript``, etc.

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: oras

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

.. code:: {command}

   From: oras://registry/namespace/image:tag

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the container to use as
a base. Also,``tag`` is mandatory that refers to the version of image
you want to use.

.. _build-localimage:

``localimage`` bootstrap agent
==============================

.. _sec:build-localimage:

This module allows you to build a container from an existing
{Project} container on your host system. The name is somewhat
misleading because your container can be in either image or directory
format.

Overview
--------

You can use an existing container image as your "base", and then add
customization. This allows you to build multiple images from the same
starting point. For example, you may want to build several containers
with the same custom python installation, the same custom compiler
toolchain, or the same base MPI installation. Instead of building these
from scratch each time, you could start with the appropriate local base
container and then customize the new container in ``%post``,
``%environment``, ``%runscript``, etc.

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: localimage

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

.. code:: {command}

   From: /path/to/container/file/or/directory

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the local container to
use as a base.

.. code:: {command}

   Fingerprints: 22045C8C0B1004D058DE4BEDA20C27EE7FF7BA84

The Fingerprints keyword is optional. It specifies one or more comma
separated fingerprints corresponding to PGP public keys. If present, and
the ``From:`` keyword points to a SIF format image, it will be verified
and the build will only proceed if it is signed by keys matching *all*
of the specified fingerprints.

Notes
-----

When building from a local container, all previous definition files that
led to the creation of the current container will be stored in a
directory within the container called
``/.singularity.d/bootstrap_history``. {Project} will also alert you
if environment variables have been changed between the base image and
the new image during bootstrap.

.. _build-yum:

``yum`` bootstrap agent
=======================

.. _sec:build-yum:

This module allows you to build a Red Hat/CentOS/Scientific Linux style
container from a mirror URI.

Overview
--------

Use the ``yum`` module to specify a base for a CentOS-like container.
You must also specify the URI for the mirror you would like to use.

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: yum

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

.. code:: {command}

   OSVersion: 7

The OSVersion keyword is optional. It specifies the OS version you would
like to use. It is only required if you have specified a %{OSVERSION}
variable in the ``MirrorURL`` keyword.

.. code:: {command}

   MirrorURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/

The MirrorURL keyword is mandatory. It specifies the URI to use as a
mirror to download the OS. If you define the ``OSVersion`` keyword, then
you can use it in the URI as in the example above.

.. code:: {command}

   Include: yum

The Include keyword is optional. It allows you to install additional
packages into the core operating system. It is a best practice to supply
only the bare essentials such that the ``%post`` section has what it
needs to properly complete the build. One common package you may want to
install when using the ``yum`` build module is YUM itself.

Notes
-----

There is a major limitation with using YUM to bootstrap a container. The
RPM database that exists within the container will be created using the
RPM library and Berkeley DB implementation that exists on the host
system. If the RPM implementation inside the container is not compatible
with the RPM database that was used to create the container, RPM and YUM
commands inside the container may fail. This issue can be easily
demonstrated by bootstrapping an older RHEL compatible image by a newer
one (e.g. bootstrap a Centos 6 container from a Centos 7 host).

In order to use the ``yum`` build module, you must have ``yum``
installed on your system. It may seem counter-intuitive to install YUM
on a system that uses a different package manager, but you can do so.
For instance, on Ubuntu you can install it like so:

.. code::

   $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yum

.. _build-debootstrap:

``debootstrap`` build agent
===========================

.. _sec:build-debootstrap:

This module allows you to build a Debian/Ubuntu style container from a
mirror URI.

Overview
--------

Use the ``debootstrap`` module to specify a base for a Debian-like
container. You must also specify the OS version and a URI for the mirror
you would like to use.

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: debootstrap

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

.. code:: {command}

   OSVersion: xenial

The OSVersion keyword is mandatory. It specifies the OS version you
would like to use. For Ubuntu you can use code words like ``trusty``
(14.04), ``xenial`` (16.04), and ``yakkety`` (17.04). For Debian you can
use values like ``stable``, ``oldstable``, ``testing``, and ``unstable``
or code words like ``wheezy`` (7), ``jesse`` (8), and ``stretch`` (9).

   .. code:: {command}

      MirrorURL:  http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

The MirrorURL keyword is mandatory. It specifies a URI to use as a
mirror when downloading the OS.

.. code:: {command}

   Include: somepackage

The Include keyword is optional. It allows you to install additional
packages into the core operating system. It is a best practice to supply
only the bare essentials such that the ``%post`` section has what it
needs to properly complete the build.

Notes
-----

In order to use the ``debootstrap`` build module, you must have
``debootstrap`` installed on your system. On Ubuntu you can install it
like so:

.. code::

   $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install debootstrap

On CentOS you can install it from the epel repos like so:

.. code::

   $ sudo yum update && sudo yum install epel-release && sudo yum install debootstrap.noarch

.. _build-arch:

``arch`` bootstrap agent
========================

.. _sec:build-arch:

This module allows you to build a Arch Linux based container.

Overview
--------

Use the ``arch`` module to specify a base for an Arch Linux based
container. Arch Linux uses the aptly named ``pacman`` package manager
(all puns intended).

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: arch

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

The Arch Linux bootstrap module does not name any additional keywords at
this time. By defining the ``arch`` module, you have essentially given
all of the information necessary for that particular bootstrap module to
build a core operating system.

Notes
-----

Arch Linux is, by design, a very stripped down, light-weight OS. You may
need to perform a significant amount of configuration to get a usable
OS. Please refer to this `README.md
<https://github.com/{orgrepo}/blob/master/examples/arch/README.md>`_
and the `Arch Linux example
<https://github.com/{orgrepo}/blob/master/examples/arch/>`_
for more info.

.. _build-busybox:

``busybox`` bootstrap agent
===========================

.. _sec:build-busybox:

This module allows you to build a container based on BusyBox.

Overview
--------

Use the ``busybox`` module to specify a BusyBox base for container. You
must also specify a URI for the mirror you would like to use.

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: busybox

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

.. code:: {command}

   MirrorURL: https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.35.0-x86_64-linux-musl/busybox

The MirrorURL keyword is mandatory. It specifies a URI to use as a
mirror when downloading the OS.

Notes
-----

You can build a fully functional BusyBox container that only takes up
~700kB of disk space!

.. _build-zypper:

``zypper`` bootstrap agent
==========================

.. _sec:build-zypper:

This module allows you to build a Suse style container from a mirror
URI.

.. note::

   ``zypper`` version 1.11.20 or greater is required on the host system,
   as {Project} requires the ``--releasever`` flag.

Overview
--------

Use the ``zypper`` module to specify a base for a Suse-like container.
You must also specify a URI for the mirror you would like to use.

Keywords
--------

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: zypper

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap
module to use.

.. code:: {command}

   OSVersion: 42.2

The OSVersion keyword is optional. It specifies the OS version you would
like to use. It is only required if you have specified a %{OSVERSION}
variable in the ``MirrorURL`` keyword.

.. code:: {command}

   Include: somepackage

The Include keyword is optional. It allows you to install additional
packages into the core operating system. It is a best practice to supply
only the bare essentials such that the ``%post`` section has what it
needs to properly complete the build. One common package you may want to
install when using the zypper build module is ``zypper`` itself.

.. _docker-daemon-archive:

``docker-daemon`` and ``docker-archive`` bootstrap agents
=========================================================

If you are using docker locally there are two options for creating
{Project} images without the need for a repository. You can either
build a SIF from a ``docker-save`` tar file or you can convert any
docker image present in docker's daemon internal storage.

Overview
--------

``docker-daemon`` allows you to build a SIF from any docker image
currently residing in docker's daemon internal storage:

.. code:: console

   $ docker images alpine
   REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
   alpine              latest              965ea09ff2eb        7 weeks ago         5.55MB

   $ {command} run docker-daemon:alpine:latest
   INFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format
   INFO:    Starting build...
   Getting image source signatures
   Copying blob 77cae8ab23bf done
   Copying config 759e71f0d3 done
   Writing manifest to image destination
   Storing signatures

   INFO:    Creating SIF file...
   {Project}>

while ``docker-archive`` permits you to do the same thing starting from
a docker image stored in a ``docker-save`` formatted tar file:

.. code:: console

   $ docker save -o alpine.tar alpine:latest

   $ {command} run docker-archive:$(pwd)/alpine.tar
   INFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format
   INFO:    Starting build...
   Getting image source signatures
   Copying blob 77cae8ab23bf done
   Copying config 759e71f0d3 done
   Writing manifest to image destination

   2019/12/11 15:25:09  info unpack layer: sha256:eb7c47c7f0fd0054242f35366d166e6b041dfb0b89e5f93a82ad3a3206222502
   INFO:    Creating SIF file...
   {Project}>

Keywords
--------

The ``docker-daemon`` bootstrap agent can be used in {aProject}
definition file as follows:

.. code:: {command}

   From: docker-daemon:<image>:<tag>

where both ``<image>`` and ``<tag>`` are mandatory fields that must be
written explicitly. The ``docker-archive`` bootstrap agent requires
instead the path to the tar file containing the image:

.. code:: {command}

   From: docker-archive:<path-to-tar-file>

Note that differently from the ``docker://`` bootstrap agent both
``docker-daemon`` and ``docker-archive`` don't require a double slash
``//`` after the colon in the agent name.

.. _scratch-agent:

``scratch`` bootstrap agent
===========================

The scratch bootstrap agent allows you to start from a completely empty
container. You are then responsible for adding any and all executables,
libraries etc. that are required. Starting with a scratch container can
be useful when you are aiming to minimize container size, and have a
simple application / static binaries.

Overview
--------

A minimal container providing a shell can be created by copying the
``busybox`` static binary into an empty scratch container:

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: scratch

   %setup
       # Runs on host - fetch static busybox binary
       curl -o /tmp/busybox https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.31.0-i686-uclibc/busybox
       # It needs to be executable
       chmod +x /tmp/busybox

   %files
       # Copy from host into empty container
       /tmp/busybox /bin/sh

   %runscript
      /bin/sh

The resulting container provides a shell, and is 696KiB in size:

.. code::

   $ ls -lah scratch.sif
   -rwxr-xr-x. 1 dave dave 696K May 28 13:29 scratch.sif

   $ {command} run scratch.sif
   WARNING: passwd file doesn't exist in container, not updating
   WARNING: group file doesn't exist in container, not updating
   {Project}> echo "Hello from a 696KiB container"
   Hello from a 696KiB container

.. code:: {command}

   Bootstrap: scratch

There are no additional keywords for the scratch bootstrap agent.
