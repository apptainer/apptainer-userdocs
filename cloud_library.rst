 Overview

The Sylabs Cloud Library is the place to :ref:`push <push>` your
containers to the cloud so other users can :ref:`pull <pull>`,
:ref:`verify <signNverify>`, and use them.

.. _make_a_account:

*****************
 Make an Account
*****************

Making an account is easy, and straightforward:

   #. Go to: https://cloud.sylabs.io/library.
   #. Click "Sign in to Sylabs" (top right corner).
   #. Select your method to sign in, with Google, GitHub, GitLab, or
      Microsoft.
   #. Type your passwords, and that's it!

.. _creating_a_access_token:

*************************
 Creating a Access token
*************************

Access tokens for pushing a container.

To generate a access token, do the following steps:

   #. Go to: https://cloud.sylabs.io/
   #. Click "Sign In" and follow the sign in steps.
   #. Click on your login id (same and updated button as the Sign in
      one).
   #. Select "Access Tokens" from the drop down menu.
   #. Enter a name for your new access token, such as "test token"
   #. Click the "Create a New Access Token" button.
   #. Click "Copy token to Clipboard" from the "New API Token" page.
   #. Run ``singularity remote login`` and paste the access token at the
      prompt.

Now that you have your token, you are ready to push your container!

.. _push:

*********************
 Pushing a Container
*********************

The ``singularity push`` command will push a container to the container
library with the given URL. Here's an example of a typical push command:

.. code::

   $ singularity push my-container.sif library://your-name/project-dir/my-container:latest

The ``:latest`` is the container tag. Tags are used to have different
version of the same container.

.. note::

   When pushing your container, there's no need to add a ``.sif``
   (Singularity Image Format) to the end of the container name, (like on
   your local machine), because all containers on the library are SIF
   containers.

Let's assume you have your container (v1.0.1), and you want to push that
container without deleting your ``:latest`` container, then you can add
a version tag to that container, like so:

.. code::

   $ singularity push my-container.sif library://your-name/project-dir/my-container:1.0.1

You can download the container with that tag by replacing the
``:latest``, with the tagged container you want to download.

To set a description against the container image as you push it, use the
`-D` flag introduced in {Singularity} 3.7. This provides an alternative
to setting the description via the web interface:

.. code:: console

   $ singularity push -D "My alpine 3.11 container" alpine_3.11.sif library://myuser/examples/alpine:3.11
   2.7MiB / 2.7MiB [=========================================================================] 100 % 1.1 MiB/s 0s

   Library storage: using 13.24 MiB out of 11.00 GiB quota (0.1% used)
   Container URL: https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/myuser/examples/alpine

Note that when you push to a library that supports it, {Singularity} 3.7
and above will report your quota usage and the direct URL to view the
container in your web browser.

.. _pull:

*********************
 Pulling a container
*********************

The ``singularity pull`` command will download a container from the
`Library <https://cloud.sylabs.io/library>`_ (``library://``), `Docker
Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_ (``docker://``), and also `Shub
<https://singularity-hub.org>`_ (``shub://``).

.. note::

   When pulling from Docker, the container will automatically be
   converted to a SIF (Singularity Image Format) container.

Here's a typical pull command:

.. code::

   $ singularity pull file-out.sif library://alpine:latest

   # or pull from docker:

   $ singularity pull file-out.sif docker://alpine:latest

.. note::

   If there's no tag after the container name, {Singularity}
   automatically will pull the container with the ``:latest`` tag.

To pull a container with a specific tag, just add the tag to the library
URL:

.. code::

   $ singularity pull file-out.sif library://alpine:3.8

Of course, you can pull your own containers. Here's what that will look
like:

Pulling your own container
==========================

Pulling your own container is just like pulling from Github, Docker,
etc...

.. code::

   $ singularity pull out-file.sif library://your-name/project-dir/my-container:latest

   # or use a different tag:

   $ singularity pull out-file.sif library://your-name/project-dir/my-container:1.0.1

.. note::

   You *don't* have to specify a output file, one will be created
   automatically, but it's good practice to always specify your output
   file.

****************************
 Verify/Sign your Container
****************************

Verify containers that you pull from the library, ensuring they are
bit-for-bit reproductions of the original image.

Check out :ref:`this page <signNverify>` on how to: :ref:`verify a
container <verify_container_from_library>`, :ref:`making PGP key, and
sign your own containers <sign_your_own_containers>`.

.. _search_the_library:

**************************************
 Searching the Library for Containers
**************************************

To find interesting or useful containers in the library, you can open
https://cloud.sylabs.io/library in your browser and search from there
through the web GUI.

Alternatively, from the CLI you can use ``singularity search <query>``.
This will search the library for container images matching ``<query>``.

Using the CLI Search
====================

Here is an example of searching the library for ``centos``:

.. code:: console

   singularity search centos
   Found 72 container images for amd64 matching "centos":

       library://dcsouthwick/iotools/centos7:latest

       library://dcsouthwick/iotools/centos7:sha256.48e81523aaad3d74e7af8b154ac5e75f2726cc6cab37f718237d8f89d905ff89
               Minimal centos7 image from yum bootstrap

       library://dtrudg/linux/centos:7,centos7,latest

       library://dtrudg/linux/centos:centos6,6

       library://emmeff/centos/centos:8

       library://essen1999/default/centos-tree:latest

       library://gallig/default/centos_benchmark-signed:7.7.1908
               Signed by: 6B44B0BC9CD273CC6A71DA8CED6FA43EF8771A02

       library://gmk/default/centos7-devel:latest
               Signed by: 7853F08767A4596B3C1AD95E48E1080AB16ED1BC

Containers can have multiple tags, and these are shown separated by
commas after the ``:`` in the URL. E.g.
``library://dtrudg/linux/centos:7,centos7,latest`` is a single container
image with 3 tags, ``7``, ``centos7``, and ``latest``. You can
``singularity pull`` the container image using any one of these tags.

Note that the results show ``amd64`` containers only. By default
``search`` returns only containers with an architecture matching your
current system. To e.g. search for ``arm64`` containers from an
``amd64`` machine you can use the ``--arch`` flag:

.. code:: console

   singularity search --arch arm64 alpine
   Found 5 container images for arm64 matching "alpine":

       library://dtrudg-sylabs-2/multiarch/alpine:latest

       library://geoffroy.vallee/alpine/alpine:latest
               Signed by: 9D56FA7CAFB4A37729751B8A21749D0D6447B268

       library://library/default/alpine:3.11.5,latest,3,3.11

       library://library/default/alpine:3.9,3.9.2

       library://sylabs/tests/passphrase_encrypted_alpine:3.11.5

You can also limit results to only signed containers with the
``--signed`` flag:

.. code:: console

   singularity search --signed alpine
   Found 45 container images for amd64 matching "alpine":

       library://deep/default/alpine:latest,1.0.1
               Signed by: 8883491F4268F173C6E5DC49EDECE4F3F38D871E

Building from a definition file:
================================

This is our definition file. Let's call it ``ubuntu.def``:

.. code:: singularity

   bootstrap: library
   from: ubuntu:18.04

   %runscript
       echo "hello world from ubuntu container!"

Now, to build the container, use the ``--remote`` flag, and without
``sudo``:

.. code::

   $ singularity build --remote ubuntu.sif ubuntu.def

.. note::

   Make sure you have a :ref:`access token <creating_a_access_token>`,
   otherwise the build will fail.

After building, you can test your container like so:

.. code::

   $ ./ubuntu.sif
   hello world from ubuntu container!
