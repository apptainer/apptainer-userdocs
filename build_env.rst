 Overview
**********

You may wish to customize your build environment by doing things such as
specifying a custom cache directory for images or sending your Docker
Credentials to the registry endpoint. Here we will discuss these and
other topics related to the build environment.

.. _sec:cache:

***************
 Cache Folders
***************

{Singularity} will cache SIF container images generated from remote
sources, and any OCI/docker layers used to create them. The cache is
created at ``$HOME/.singularity/cache`` by default. The location of the
cache can be changed by setting the ``SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`` environment
variable.

When you run builds as root, using ``sudo``, images will be cached in
root’s home at ``/root`` and not your user’s home. Use the ``-E`` option
to sudo to pass through the ``SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`` environment
variable, if you set it.

.. code::

   $ export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/tmp/user/temporary-cache

   # Running a build under your user account
   $ singularity build --fakeroot myimage.sif mydef.def

   # Running a build with sudo, must use -E to pass env var
   $ sudo -E singularity build myimage.sif mydef.def

If you change the value of ``SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`` be sure to choose a
location that is:

   -  Unique to you. Permissions are set on the cache so that private
      images cached for one user are not exposed to another. This means
      that ``SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`` cannot be shared.

   -  Located on a filesystem with sufficient space for the number and
      size of container images anticipated.

   -  Located on a filesystem that supports atomic rename, if possible.

.. warning::

   If you are not certain that your ``$HOME`` or
   ``SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`` filesystems support atomic rename, do not
   run {Singularity} in parallel using remote container URLs. Instead
   use ``singularity pull`` to create a local SIF image, and then run
   this SIF image in a parallel step. An alternative is to use the
   ``--disable-cache`` option, but this will result in each
   {Singularity} instance independently fetching the container from the
   remote source, into a temporary location.

Inside the cache location you will find separate directories for the
different kinds of data that are cached:

.. code::

   $HOME/.singularity/cache/blob
   $HOME/.singularity/cache/library
   $HOME/.singularity/cache/net
   $HOME/.singularity/cache/oci-tmp
   $HOME/.singularity/cache/shub

You can safely delete these directories, or content within them.
{Singularity} will re-create any directories and data that are needed in
future runs.

You should not add any additional files, or modify files in the cache,
as this may cause checksum / integrity errors when you run or build
containers. If you experience problems use ``singularity cache clean``
to reset the cache to a clean, empty state.

BoltDB Corruption Errors
========================

The library that {Singularity} uses to retrieve and cache Docker/OCI
layers keeps track of them using a single file database. If your home
directory is on a network filesystem which experiences interruptions, or
you run out of storage, it is possible for this database to become
inconsistent.

If you observe error messages when trying to run {Singularity} that
mention `github.com/etcd-io/bbolt` then you should remove the database
file:

.. code::

   rm ~/.local/share/containers/cache/blob-info-cache-v1.boltdb

****************
 Cache commands
****************

The ``cache`` command for {Singularity} allows you to view and clean up
your cache, without manually inspecting the cache directories.

.. note::

   If you have built images as root, directly or via ``sudo``, the cache
   location for those builds is ``/root/.singularity``. You will need to
   use ``sudo`` when running ``cache clean`` or ``cache list`` to manage
   these cache entries.

Listing Cache
=============

To view a summary of cache usage, use ``singularity cache list``:

.. code::

   $ singularity cache list
   There are 4 container file(s) using 59.45 MB and 23 oci blob file(s) using 379.10 MB of space
   Total space used: 438.55 MB

To view detailed information, use ``singularity cache list -v``:

.. code::

   $ singularity cache list -v

   There are 4 container file(s) using 59.45 MB and 23 oci blob file(s) using 379.10 MB of space
   Total space used: 438.55 MB

All cache entries are named using a content hash, so that identical
layers or images that are pulled from different URIs do not consume more
space than needed.

Entries marked ``blob`` are OCI/docker layers and manifests, that are
used to create SIF format images in the ``oci-tmp`` cache. Other caches
are named for the source of the image e.g. ``library`` and ``oras``.

You can limit the cache list to a specific cache type with the ``-type``
/ ``-t`` option.

Cleaning the Cache
==================

To reclaim space used by the {Singularity} cache, use ``singularity
cache clean``.

By default ``singularity cache clean`` will remove all cache entries,
after asking you to confirm:

.. code::

   $ singularity cache clean
   This will delete everything in your cache (containers from all sources and OCI blobs).
   Hint: You can see exactly what would be deleted by canceling and using the --dry-run option.
   Do you want to continue? [N/y] n

Use the ``--dry-run`` / ``-n`` option to see the files that would be
deleted, or the ``--force`` / ``-f`` option to clean without asking for
confirmation.

If you want to leave your most recent cached images in place, but remove
images that were cached longer ago, you can use the ``--days`` / ``-d``
option. E.g. to clean cache entries older than 30 days:

.. code::

   $ singularity cache clean --days 30

To remove only a specific kind of cache entry, e.g. only library images,
use the ``type`` / ``-T`` option:

.. code::

   $ singularity cache clean --type library

.. _sec:temporaryfolders:

*******************
 Temporary Folders
*******************

When building a container, or pulling/running a {Singularity} container
from a Docker/OCI source, a temporary working space is required. The
container is constructed in this temporary space before being packaged
into a {Singularity} SIF image. Temporary space is also used when
running containers in unprivileged mode, and performing some operations
on filesystems that do not fully support ``--fakeroot``.

The location for temporary directories defaults to ``/tmp``.
{Singularity} will also respect the environment variable ``TMPDIR``, and
both of these locations can be overridden by setting the environment
variable ``SINGULARITY_TMPDIR``.

The temporary directory used during a build must be on a filesystem that
has enough space to hold the entire container image, uncompressed,
including any temporary files that are created and later removed during
the build. You may need to set ``SINGULARITY_TMPDIR`` when building a
large container on a system which has a small ``/tmp`` filesystem.

Remember to use ``-E`` option to pass the value of
``SINGULARITY_TMPDIR`` to root's environment when executing the
``build`` command with ``sudo``.

.. warning::

   Many modern Linux distributions use an in-memory ``tmpfs`` filesystem
   for ``/tmp`` when installed on a computer with a sufficient amount of
   RAM. This may limit the size of container you can build, as temporary
   directories under ``/tmp`` share RAM with runniing programs etc. A
   ``tmpfs`` also uses default mount options that can interfere with
   some container builds.

   Set ``SINGULARITY_TMPDIR`` to a disk location, or disable the
   ``tmpfs`` ``/tmp`` mount on your system if you experience problems.

**********************
 Encrypted Containers
**********************

With {Singularity} it is possible to build and run
encrypted containers. The containers are decrypted at runtime entirely
in kernel space, meaning that no intermediate decrypted data is ever
present on disk or in memory. See :ref:`encrypted containers
<encryption>` for more details.

***********************
 Environment Variables
***********************

#. If a flag is represented by both a CLI option and an environment
   variable, and both are set, the CLI option will always take
   precedence. This is true for all environment variables except for
   ``SINGULARITY_BIND`` and ``SINGULARITY_BINDPATH`` which is combined
   with the ``--bind`` option, argument pair if both are present.

#. Environment variables overwrite default values in the CLI code

#. Any defaults in the CLI code are applied.

Defaults
========

The following variables have defaults that can be customized by you via
environment variables at runtime.

Docker
------

**SINGULARITY_DOCKER_LOGIN** Used for the interactive login for Docker
Hub.

**SINGULARITY_DOCKER_USERNAME** Your Docker username.

**SINGULARITY_DOCKER_PASSWORD** Your Docker password.

**RUNSCRIPT_COMMAND** Is not obtained from the environment, but is a
hard coded default (“/bin/bash”). This is the fallback command used in
the case that the docker image does not have a CMD or ENTRYPOINT.
**TAG** Is the default tag, ``latest``.

**SINGULARITY_NOHTTPS** This is relevant if you want to use a registry
that doesn’t have https, and it speaks for itself. If you export the
variable ``SINGULARITY_NOHTTPS`` you can force the software to not use
https when interacting with a Docker registry. This use case is
typically for use of a local registry.

Library
-------

**SINGULARITY_LIBRARY** Used to specify the library to pull from.
Default is set to our Cloud Library.

**SINGULARITY_REMOTE** Used to build an image remotely (This does not
require root). The default is set to false.

Encryption
----------

**SINGULARITY_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE** Used to pass a plaintext
passphrase to encrypt a container file system (with the ``--encrypt``
flag). The default is empty.

**SINGULARITY_ENCRYPTION_PEM_PATH** Used to specify the location of a
public key to use for container encryption (with the ``--encrypt``
flag). The default is empty.
