 Contributing

{Project} is an open source project, meaning we have the challenge
of limited resources. We are grateful for any support that you can
offer. Helping other users, raising issues, helping write documentation,
or contributing code are all ways to help!

********************
 Join the community
********************

This is a huge endeavor, and your help would be greatly appreciated!
Post to online communities about {Project}, and request that your
distribution vendor, service provider, and system administrators include
{Project} for you!

 Raise an Issue
****************

For general bugs/issues, you can open an issue `at the GitHub repo
<https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/issues/new>`_. However, if you
find a security related issue/problem, please email the {Project} Security Team directly at
security@apptainer.org. More information about the {Project} security policies
and procedures can be found `here
<https://apptainer.org/security-policy/>`__

*********************
 Write Documentation
*********************

We (like almost all open source software providers) have a documentation
dilemma… We tend to focus on the code features and functionality before
working on documentation. And there is very good reason for this: we
want to share the love so nobody feels left out!

You can contribute to the documentation by `raising an issue to suggest
an improvement
<https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer-userdocs/issues/new>`_ or by
sending a `pull request
<https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer-userdocs/compare>`_ on `our
repository for documentation
<https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer-userdocs>`_.

The current documentation is generated with:

-  `reStructured Text (RST) <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
   and `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_.

Other dependencies include:

-  `Python 3.5 or newer <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
-  `Sphinx <https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/>`_.

More information about contributing to the documentation, instructions
on how to install the dependencies, and how to generate the files can be
obtained `here
<https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer-userdocs/blob/master/README.md>`__.

For more information on using Git and GitHub to create a pull request
suggesting additions and edits to the docs, see the :ref:`section on
contributing to the code <contribute-to-the-code>`. The procedure is
identical for contributions to the documentation and the code base.

.. _contribute-to-the-code:

************************
 Contribute to the code
************************

We use the traditional `GitHub Flow
<https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_ to develop. This means
that you fork the main repo, create a new branch to make changes, and
submit a pull request (PR) to the master branch.

Check out our official `CONTRIBUTING.md
<https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
document, which also includes a `code of conduct
<https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct>`_.

Step 1. Fork the repo
=====================

To contribute to {Project}, you should obtain a GitHub account and
fork the `{Project} <https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer>`_
repository. Once forked, clone your fork of the repo to your computer.
(Obviously, you should replace ``your-username`` with your GitHub
username.)

.. code::

   $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/{command}.git && \
       cd {command}/

Step 2. Checkout a new branch
=============================

`Branches <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow//>`_ are a way of
isolating your features from the main branch. Given that we’ve just
cloned the repo, we will probably want to make a new branch from master
in which to work on our new feature. Lets call that branch
``new-feature``:

.. code::

   $ git checkout master && \
       git checkout -b new-feature

.. note::

   You can always check which branch you are in by running ``git
   branch``.

Step 3. Make your changes
=========================

On your new branch, go nuts! Make changes, test them, and when you are
happy commit the changes to the branch:

.. code::

   $ git add file-changed1 file-changed2...

   $ git commit -m "what changed?"

This commit message is important - it should describe exactly the
changes that you have made. Good commit messages read like so:

.. code::

   $ git commit -m "changed function getConfig in functions.go to output csv to fix #2"

   $ git commit -m "updated docs about shell to close #10"

The tags ``close #10`` and ``fix #2`` are referencing issues that are
posted on the upstream repo where you will direct your pull request.
When your PR is merged into the master branch, these messages will
automatically close the issues, and further, they will link your commits
directly to the issues they intend to fix. This will help future
maintainers understand your contribution, or (hopefully not) revert the
code back to a previous version if necessary.

Step 4. Push your branch to your fork
=====================================

When you are done with your commits, you should push your branch to your
fork (and you can also continuously push commits here as you work):

.. code::

   $ git push origin new-feature

Note that you should always check the status of your branches to see
what has been pushed (or not):

.. code::

   $ git status

Step 5. Submit a Pull Request
=============================

Once you have pushed your branch, then you can go to your fork (in the
web GUI on GitHub) and `submit a Pull Request
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_.
Regardless of the name of your branch, your PR should be submitted to
the {Project} ``master`` branch. Submitting your PR will open a
conversation thread for the maintainers of {Project} to discuss your
contribution. At this time, the continuous integration that is linked
with the code base will also be executed. If there is an issue, or if
the maintainers suggest changes, you can continue to push commits to
your branch and they will update the Pull Request.

Step 6. Keep your branch in sync
================================

Cloning the repo will create an exact copy of the {Project}
repository at that moment. As you work, your branch may become out of
date as others merge changes into the upstream master. In the event that
you need to update a branch, you will need to follow the next steps:

.. code::

   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer.git && # to add a new remote named "upstream" \
       git checkout master && # or another branch to be updated \
       git pull upstream master && \
       git push origin master && # to update your fork \
       git checkout new-feature && \
       git merge master
