{Project} has the ability to create and manage PGP keys
and use them to sign and verify containers. This provides a trusted
method for {Project} users to share containers. It ensures a
bit-for-bit reproduction of the original container as the author
intended it.

.. note::

   To verify containers signed with Singularity versions older than
   3.6.0 the ``--legacy-insecure`` flag must be provided to the
   ``{command} verify`` command.

.. _verify_container_from_library:

*************************************************
 Verifying containers from the Container Library
*************************************************

The ``verify`` command will allow you to verify that a container has
been signed using a PGP key. To use this feature with images that you
pull from the container library, you must first generate an access token
to the Sylabs Cloud. If you don't already have a valid access token,
follow these steps:

   #. Go to: https://cloud.sylabs.io/
   #. Click "Sign In" and follow the sign in steps.
   #. Click on your login id (same and updated button as the Sign in
      one).
   #. Select "Access Tokens" from the drop down menu.
   #. Enter a name for your new access token, such as "test token"
   #. Click the "Create a New Access Token" button.
   #. Click "Copy token to Clipboard" from the "New API Token" page.
   #. Run ``{command} remote login`` and paste the access token at the
      prompt.

Now you can verify containers that you pull from the library, ensuring
they are bit-for-bit reproductions of the original image.

.. code::

   $ {command} verify alpine_latest.sif

   Container is signed by 1 key(s):

   Verifying partition: FS:
   8883491F4268F173C6E5DC49EDECE4F3F38D871E
   [REMOTE]  Sylabs Admin <support@sylabs.io>
   [OK]      Data integrity verified

   INFO:    Container verified: alpine_latest.sif

In this example you can see that **Sylabs Admin** has signed the
container.

.. _sign_your_own_containers:

*****************************
 Signing your own containers
*****************************

Generating and managing PGP keys
================================

To sign your own containers you first need to generate one or more keys.

If you attempt to sign a container before you have generated any keys,
{Project} will guide you through the interactive process of creating
a new key. Or you can use the ``newpair`` subcommand in the ``key``
command group like so:.

.. code::

   $ {command} key newpair

   Enter your name (e.g., John Doe) : David Trudgian
   Enter your email address (e.g., john.doe@example.com) : david.trudgian@sylabs.io
   Enter optional comment (e.g., development keys) : demo
   Enter a passphrase :
   Retype your passphrase :
   Would you like to push it to the keystore? [Y,n] Y
   Generating Entity and OpenPGP Key Pair... done
   Key successfully pushed to: https://keys.sylabs.io

Note that I chose ``Y`` when asked if I wanted to push my key to the
keystore. This will push my public key to whichever keystore has been
configured by the ``{command} remote`` command, so that it can be
retrieved by other users running ``{command} verify``. If you do not
wish to push your public key, say ``n`` during the ``newpair`` process.

The ``list`` subcommand will show you all of the keys you have created
or saved locally.`

.. code::

   $ {command} key list

   Public key listing (/home/dave/.singularity/sypgp/pgp-public):

   0) U: David Trudgian (demo) <david.trudgian@sylabs.io>
      C: 2019-11-15 09:54:54 -0600 CST
      F: E5F780B2C22F59DF748524B435C3844412EE233B
      L: 4096
      --------

In the output above the index of my key is ``0`` and the letters stand
for the following:

   -  U: User
   -  C: Creation date and time
   -  F: Fingerprint
   -  L: Key length

If you chose not to push your key to the keystore during the ``newpair``
process, but later wish to, you can push it to a keystore configured
using ``{command} remote`` like so:

.. code::

   $ {command} key push E5F780B2C22F59DF748524B435C3844412EE233B

   public key `E5F780B2C22F59DF748524B435C3844412EE233B` pushed to server successfully

If you delete your local public PGP key, you can always locate and
download it again like so.

.. code::

   $ {command} key search Trudgian

   Showing 1 results

   KEY ID    BITS  NAME/EMAIL
   12EE233B  4096  David Trudgian (demo) <david.trudgian@sylabs.io>

   $ {command} key pull 12EE233B

   1 key(s) added to keyring of trust /home/dave/.singularity/sypgp/pgp-public

But note that this only restores the *public* key (used for verifying)
to your local machine and does not restore the *private* key (used for
signing).

.. _searching_for_keys:

Searching for keys
==================

{Project} allows you to search the keystore for public keys. You can
search for names, emails, and fingerprints (key IDs). When searching for
a fingerprint, you need to use ``0x`` before the fingerprint, check the
example:

.. code::

   # search for key ID:
   $ {command} key search 0x8883491F4268F173C6E5DC49EDECE4F3F38D871E

   # search for the sort ID:
   $ {command} key search 0xF38D871E

   # search for user:
   $ {command} key search Godlove

   # search for email:
   $ {command} key search @gmail.com

Signing and validating your own containers
==========================================

Now that you have a key generated, you can use it to sign images like
so:

.. code::

   $ {command} sign my_container.sif

   Signing image: my_container.sif
   Enter key passphrase :
   Signature created and applied to my_container.sif

Because your public PGP key is saved locally you can verify the image
without needing to contact the Keystore.

.. code::

   $ {command} verify my_container.sif
   Verifying image: my_container.sif
   [LOCAL]   Signing entity: David Trudgian (Demo keys) <david.trudgian@sylabs.io>
   [LOCAL]   Fingerprint: 65833F473098C6215E750B3BDFD69E5CEE85D448
   Objects verified:
   ID  |GROUP   |LINK    |TYPE
   ------------------------------------------------
   1   |1       |NONE    |Def.FILE
   2   |1       |NONE    |JSON.Generic
   3   |1       |NONE    |FS
   Container verified: my_container.sif

If you've pushed your key to the Keystore you can also verify this image
in the absence of a local public key. To demonstrate this, first
``remove`` your local public key, and then try to use the ``verify``
command again.

.. code::

   $ {command} key remove E5F780B2C22F59DF748524B435C3844412EE233B

   $ {command} verify my_container.sif
   Verifying image: my_container.sif
   [REMOTE]   Signing entity: David Trudgian (Demo keys) <david.trudgian@sylabs.io>
   [REMOTE]   Fingerprint: 65833F473098C6215E750B3BDFD69E5CEE85D448
   Objects verified:
   ID  |GROUP   |LINK    |TYPE
   ------------------------------------------------
   1   |1       |NONE    |Def.FILE
   2   |1       |NONE    |JSON.Generic
   3   |1       |NONE    |FS
   Container verified: my_container.sif

Note that the ``[REMOTE]`` message shows the key used for verification
was obtained from the keystore, and is not present on your local
computer. You can retrieve it, so that you can verify even if you are
offline with ``{command} key pull``

.. code::

   $ {command} key pull E5F780B2C22F59DF748524B435C3844412EE233B

   1 key(s) added to keyring of trust /home/dave/.singularity/sypgp/pgp-public

Advanced Signing - SIF IDs and Groups
=====================================

As well as the default behaviour, which signs all objects, fine-grained
control of signing is possible.

If you ``sif list`` a SIF file you will see it is comprised of a number
of objects. Each object has an ``ID``, and belongs to a ``GROUP``.

.. code::

   $ {command} sif list my_container.sif

   Container id: e455d2ae-7f0b-4c79-b3ef-315a4913d76a
   Created on:   2019-11-15 10:11:58 -0600 CST
   Modified on:  2019-11-15 10:11:58 -0600 CST
   ----------------------------------------------------
   Descriptor list:
   ID   |GROUP   |LINK    |SIF POSITION (start-end)  |TYPE
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1    |1       |NONE    |32768-32800               |Def.FILE
   2    |1       |NONE    |36864-36961               |JSON.Generic
   3    |1       |NONE    |40960-25890816            |FS (Squashfs/*System/amd64)

I can choose to sign and verify a specific object with the ``--sif-id``
option to ``sign`` and ``verify``.

.. code::

   $ {command} sign --sif-id 1 my_container.sif
   Signing image: my_container.sif
   Enter key passphrase :
   Signature created and applied to my_container.sif

   $ {command} verify --sif-id 1 my_container.sif
   Verifying image: my_container.sif
   [LOCAL]   Signing entity: David Trudgian (Demo keys) <david.trudgian@sylabs.io>
   [LOCAL]   Fingerprint: 65833F473098C6215E750B3BDFD69E5CEE85D448
   Objects verified:
   ID  |GROUP   |LINK    |TYPE
   ------------------------------------------------
   1   |1       |NONE    |Def.FILE
   Container verified: my_container.sif

Note that running the ``verify`` command without specifying the specific
sif-id gives a fatal error. The container is not considered verified as
whole because other objects could have been changed without my
knowledge.

.. code::

   $ {command} verify my_container.sif
   Verifying image: my_container.sif
   [LOCAL]   Signing entity: David Trudgian (Demo keys) <david.trudgian@sylabs.io>
   [LOCAL]   Fingerprint: 65833F473098C6215E750B3BDFD69E5CEE85D448

   Error encountered during signature verification: object 2: object not signed
   FATAL:   Failed to verify container: integrity: object 2: object not signed

I can sign a group of objects with the ``--group-id`` option to
``sign``.

.. code::

   $ {command} sign --groupid 1 my_container.sif
   Signing image: my_container.sif
   Enter key passphrase :
   Signature created and applied to my_container.sif

This creates one signature over all objects in the group. I can verify
that nothing in the group has been modified by running ``verify`` with
the same ``--group-id`` option.

.. code::

   $ {command} verify --group-id 1 my_container.sif
   Verifying image: my_container.sif
   [LOCAL]   Signing entity: David Trudgian (Demo keys) <david.trudgian@sylabs.io>
   [LOCAL]   Fingerprint: 65833F473098C6215E750B3BDFD69E5CEE85D448
   Objects verified:
   ID  |GROUP   |LINK    |TYPE
   ------------------------------------------------
   1   |1       |NONE    |Def.FILE
   2   |1       |NONE    |JSON.Generic
   3   |1       |NONE    |FS
   Container verified: my_container.sif

Because every object in the SIF file is within the signed group 1 the
entire container is signed, and the default ``verify`` behavior without
specifying ``--group-id`` can also verify the container:

.. code::

   $ {command} verify my_container.sif
   Verifying image: my_container.sif
   [LOCAL]   Signing entity: David Trudgian (Demo keys) <david.trudgian@sylabs.io>
   [LOCAL]   Fingerprint: 65833F473098C6215E750B3BDFD69E5CEE85D448
   Objects verified:
   ID  |GROUP   |LINK    |TYPE
   ------------------------------------------------
   1   |1       |NONE    |Def.FILE
   2   |1       |NONE    |JSON.Generic
   3   |1       |NONE    |FS
   Container verified: my_container.sif
